1. Get the base svg from here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Metro_Manila
2. Adjust it in the countrymap.js and mapdata.js
3. Fix the Taguig one
	- put the base.svg in here https://boxy-svg.com/app
	- then move out the taguig part and export, this way it will not have that transform thats fucking it up
	- put the result here to transform it from absolute path string to relative https://codepen.io/MausWorks/pen/eLrmmY
	- put it in the countrymap.js and fix its x and y
4. add the right data
5. that's it
